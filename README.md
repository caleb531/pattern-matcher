# CS 421 Programming Assignment: Pattern Matcher
*Copyright 2016 Brittany Dibble, Caleb Evans*

For this school project, we were to write a program that simulates a
non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) to search for a series of phrases
within a single text file, identifying the section of the file where each phrase
was found.

## Setup 

To compile the program, run:  
```bash
g++ pattern-matcher.cpp -o pattern-matcher.out
```

To execute the compiled program, run:  
```bash
./pattern-matcher.out
```
